Intro:  Am  G   Am

Am                G    Am
As I was walking all alane
Am                    G     Am
I heard twa corbies makin' mane;
          C                  G
And one ontae the other did say,
Am                        G        Am
“Where shall we gang and dine the day
Am                       G        Am
Where shall we gang and dine the day?”
